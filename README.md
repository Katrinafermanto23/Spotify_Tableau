# Spotify_Tableau

This is a breakdown of the best and most popular artist of Spotify 2024. In this Tableau page, I created a break down to visualize which artist has the most streams, which songs were the most popular and added in the playlist which indicates that users are in their "sit back" mode and have intergated the music into their everyday lives. Moreover the number of tracks that artist has means how many songs these artise has released. It would be great to note that artist that has more releases is mosyt likely to have more streams.
